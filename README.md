## Full Stack Challenge

This is a front-end part of a fake "Pizza Delivery" application meant to be used for demonstration purposes only.

It is written in React and **TypeScript**.

## Features

menu | currency switch | delivery cost | login | registration | order history for logged in users (with pagination) | server-side and client-side form validation

## Installation

Grab the pre-built version from releases page

Or build like any other `create-react-app` with npm, but I would strongly recommend to use **Yarn 2** instead.
